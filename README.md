# Sentiment and Engagement Analysis of YouTube Video Comments

This project aims to analyze the sentiments expressed in YouTube comments to uncover insights about public reactions to various videos. Using a dataset containing YouTube comments along with metadata such as views, likes, dislikes, and channel information, the project performs several key tasks:

**Data Loading and Cleaning:** Efficiently loads the dataset and handles missing values to ensure data integrity.
**Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes the TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis, classifying comments as positive, neutral, or negative.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Generates visualizations to explore the distribution of sentiments and their correlation with engagement metrics.
**Feature Engineering:** Calculates additional metrics such as like rate, dislike rate, and comment rate to enhance the analysis.
**Visualization:** Creates a variety of plots to illustrate key findings, including word clouds, box plots, and heatmaps.

The project provides a comprehensive look at how viewers react to content on YouTube, offering valuable insights for content creators and analysts interested in understanding public opinion and engagement trends.

# Future Work
Explore advanced sentiment analysis techniques and machine learning models.
Improve interactivity of visualizations for deeper data exploration.
Extend the analysis to include other features in the dataset for more comprehensive insights.
